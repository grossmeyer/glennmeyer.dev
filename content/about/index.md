I'm a life-long learner and tech enthusiast. When I was 5 years old, my father bought a refurbished Apple Macintosh Plus and we were a "Mac family" for most of my childhood. I became endlessly fascinated with computers and video games. I played mostly Blizzard games, but I was jealous of other people who could do whatever they wanted on "Windows." When I turned 12, I purchased a used Cyrix 100Mhz system from my uncle and learned how to install and operate Windows 95, upgraded the hardware (I quickly got rid of that garbage Cyrix for a Pentium 233 w/MMX!), and finally played some _real_ games! Later I bought a Dell XPS desktop for my 14th birthday, but after realizing I could've built my own PC with better specs for less money, I decided to never buy a retail desktop ever again. Over the past twenty years I've built dozens of PCs for family, friends, and myself.

My current PC is already a few years old now, but it does what I need:
  * i5-6600K (lightly overclocked)
  * EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
  * 16GB RAM
  * Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD
  * Hitachi 1.5TB RAID1

I'll be building a new PC this year with my wife (she wants to learn) and we're going to use AMD for the CPU this go around. The new Ryzen chips look sick!

As for the other parts of my life, I originally went to college for Accounting and Finance and my aspiration in my early twenties was to be a CFO someday. I went through a pretty rough part of my life only 3 semesters from graduating from the University of Kansas and ended up dropping out and moved back in with my family for a year to get my life sorted out. In January 2010, I got a job as a PC technician at The Ohio State University and my career has taken off ever since.

In 2017, I made the decision to finish my degree, and I will be graduating _summa cum laude_ at Cleveland State University this May 2020 with a BBA in Management (and a minor in Accounting).

These days I am most interested in cloud computing technology and software development, especially embracing and being a part of the DevOps culture. I have played around in all three major cloud platforms, but most of my time has been in Azure (I'm currently studying for AZ-103 Azure Administrator). On top of that, playing with KubernetesI have also been learning how to code, spending most of my time

## Resources that helped me learn Hugo

I learned the basics by watching these videos by [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3)

Picked up a few extra ideas from [Chris Stayte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7vpcqA6SEQ)

Netlify has a [nice tutorial](https://learn.netlify.com/en/basics/)

The [offical Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is great for going deep on how Hugo works

Found some random stuff on the [Hugo Discourse Forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/)
