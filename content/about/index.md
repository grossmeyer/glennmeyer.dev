## Early Life

When I was 5 years old, my father bought a refurbished Apple Macintosh Plus and thus we became a "Mac family" for most of my childhood. I became endlessly fascinated with computers and especially video games; I played mostly Blizzard games (since they were the few AAA titles that were Mac-compatible), but I was jealous of other people who could play all those other games on "Windows." When I turned 12, I purchased a used Cyrix 100MHz system from my uncle and learned how to install Windows 95, upgrade hardware (I quickly got rid of that garbage Cyrix for a Pentium 233 w/MMX!), and finally play some _real_ games! Later I bought a Dell XPS desktop for my 14th birthday, but after realizing I could've built my own PC with better specs for less money, I decided to never buy a retail desktop ever again. Over the past twenty years I've built dozens of PCs for family, friends, and myself.

My current PC is already a few years old now, but it suits my needs:
  * i5-6600K (lightly overclocked)
  * EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
  * 16GB RAM
  * Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD
  * Hitachi 1.5TB RAID1

I'll be building a new PC this year with my wife (she wants to learn) and we're going to use AMD for the CPU this go around. The new Ryzen chips look sick!

## Education and Career

I originally went to college for Mechanical Engineering which I excelled in, but on a whim I took an Accounting course as an elective. I loved it so much that I decided to change my major. I completed an Associate's degree in Accounting in 2005 and my aspiration in my early twenties was to be a CFO someday. Not too long thereafter though I went through a pretty rough part of my life; I was working full-time (with a 1 hour commute) while still going to school full-time, and I just couldn't keep up. I ended up dropping out of the University of Kansas in 2007 with only 40 credit hours left to graduate. Although I wanted to eventually finish, I bounced around for several years before catching a break: in January 2010, I got a job as a PC technician at The Ohio State University and my career has taken off ever since.

Since then I've gained exposure to nearly every part of IT operations, specializing in systems and network engineering. But that unfinished degree was always gnawing in the back of my mind.

In 2017, I made the decision to finish my degree, and I will be graduating _summa cum laude_ at Cleveland State University this May 2020 with a BBA in Management (and a minor in Accounting).

## Current Interests

These days I am most interested in cloud computing technology and software development, especially everything DevOps. I have played around in all three major cloud platforms, but most of my time has been spent in Azure. Kubernetes and Docker are quite fun to use and we've been evaluating potential use cases at work recently which is pretty cool. I'm currently studying for AZ-103 Azure Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Administrator. Additionally, I have been learning how to code, working mostly with Java, but also using Python to automate some basic networking tasks.

## How This Website Was Built

I intend to write a full blog detailing how I created this website, but for now, here is the basic overview. 

For various reasons, I didn't want to create a WordPress blog. Mainly I wanted to create something that was easier to manage. I discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) after dabbling with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I messed around with several different themes before settling on with [ReFresh](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-refresh/). ReFresh is easily customizable, and I quite like the look of it.

I use Git along with GitHub so that I can easily make changes whether I am at home or working from my laptop. The source files are a public [repo](https://github.com/grossmeyer/glennmeyer.dev) if you are curious how the website is put together.

Deployment is handled automatically whenever I push changes to GitHub by using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) which then deploys the updates to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). My domain name is registered with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). 

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all of my editing as it makes working with Markdown files very straightforward.

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a package manager for Windows that makes installing programs like Hugo a snap.

My avatar was created using the Google Chrome extension [Avatar Maker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/avatar-maker/ofknlbikfofijlcjkfcihomkedmchfbn?hl=en-US).

## Resources that helped me learn Hugo

I learned the basics by watching these videos by [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).

Picked up a few extra ideas from [Chris Stayte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7vpcqA6SEQ).

Netlify has a [nice tutorial](https://learn.netlify.com/en/basics/) on Hugo basics.

The [offical Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is great for going deep on how Hugo works.

Found random helpful stuff on the [Hugo Discourse Forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/).

## Future Ideas for this website

It seems like a small thing, but I would like to match my \<a> tags to the green color scheme that I currently have customized. I've spent several hours crawling through the CSS for ReFresh, but haven't found a clean way to target just that. If anyone knows how or where to change that, please let me know!

About the only thing I don't like about the ReFresh theme is that there isn't a clean way to navigate back to the homepage. 
Ideally there would be a Home link in the top right that would take you back to the start. Not a big deal, but it bothers me.
